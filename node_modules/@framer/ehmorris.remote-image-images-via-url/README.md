# Remote Image: Display images via a URL

Add an image to your canvas by entering its URL.

Remote Image takes an image URL, and allows you to choose the imageâ€™s fill mode. Five fill modes are supported: fill, contain, cover, none, and scale down. [Read more about the fill modes here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit).
